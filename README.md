Open University Learning dataset was analyzed to see how students interact with Virtual Learning Environment and how their interactions, demographics affect the probability of them passing, failing or withdrawing from a particular course.  
Performance of course modules with time was analyzed to observe best and worst performing modules over time with respect to student scores, interactions and withdrawal rate.  

Decison Tree and data exploration helped drill down to most relevant features.  
A classification model was built using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to compare classification accuracy using confusion matrix.
